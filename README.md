 # Instruction for collecting EM trace with CW505 H-Field planar probe

```probe_position_exploration_em_trace.ipynb``` is to decide the best postion for probe placed with the real-time visualization of EM trace.

```em_trace_autoCapture.ipynb``` once the best postion is found, we can automatically collect em trace and save it to npz file
